Problem 'tsp.lp' read.
Read time = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Tried aggregator 1 time.
MIP Presolve eliminated 7 rows and 13 columns.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.01 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.01 sec. (0.01 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 8 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.01 sec. (0.01 ticks)
